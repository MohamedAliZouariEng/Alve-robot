This repository contains the capstone project for my Industrial Computer Engineer degree at The National School of Electronics and Telecommunications of Sfax (ENET'Com).

It implements a fully simulated system in Gazebo, controlled by ROS2 nodes, to automate pick-and-place tasks within a modeled industrial storage environment.
